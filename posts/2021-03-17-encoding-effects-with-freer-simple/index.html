I have <a href=/posts/2019-03-17-tagless-final-haskell.html>written</a> about how encode <strong>Effects</strong> (e.g. IO, Database access and Caching) using a <strong>Tagless Final</strong> approach. On that article, the idea was to show how to organize a program which can have different <em>Effects</em> and compose and combine them in a single program. I've also explored the <em>technique</em> of <strong>Tagless Final</strong> for representing the encoding and <a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl><strong>mtl</strong></a> in particular to <em>handle or interpret</em> effects.<h2 id=context>Context</h2><p>The majority of Industry Software Solutions nowadays cannot escape to be connected to an external Service or System. Although there are some cases where our Solutions does not need connecting to an external service, the program still needs some kind of monitoring, metrics and logs before being shipped into a production environment. Taking these into consideration, it seems inevitable to deal with side effects in our language. Therefore <strong>Effectful computations</strong> or <strong>Algebraic Effect Handlers</strong> is a very interesting and important topic for me, because it encodes <strong>Effects</strong> as a <em><strong>first-class</strong></em> citizen in our <em>FP Programs</em>.<p>Everyone of us, as <strong>Functional Programming Developer</strong> want to deal only with <em>pure</em> functions and we don't want to deal with <em>side effects</em>. But <em>pure FP</em> can happen only on small portions of our software solutions in the Industry and at the end we need to deal with <em>side effects</em>.<p>As I've explained in my previous article there are several ways to encode <strong>Effects</strong> in order to write our program with <em><strong>pure functions</strong></em> and write the interpretation or <em><strong>side effects computations</strong></em> to specific <em>Effect</em> in a decouple way. In such a way we end up with a <strong>Pure Program</strong> that could be run or interpret later with <strong>Side effects computations</strong>. This <strong>powerful abstraction</strong> allow us to <em>reason</em> about our programs as we do with <em>pure functions</em> but at the same time having the ability to run it in other <em>non-pure</em> contexts.<p>After trying different approach and libraries for encoding and handling <strong>effects</strong> in production systems, I would like to explain my experience using <a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple><em>freer-simple</em></a> which is one of my favourite and also the one that I am currently using.<h2 id=freer-simple>freer-simple</h2><p><a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/freer-simple><em>freer-simple</em></a> is an <strong>Effect System</strong> library based on some of the famous papers of <cite>Oleg Kiselyov et al.<a href=http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf>1</a></cite> about <strong>Free Monads</strong> and <strong>Extensible Effects</strong>. The features that are pointed out from the library doc it self are:<ul><li>Efficient Effect system<li>Some implementations of common MTL Monads<li>Components for defining Custom Effects</ul><p>One key feature that is not explicitly mentioned on the library doc is that <strong>Effect</strong> encoding is done at <strong>Type level</strong> using and <em>Extensible Open Union Type</em> (a type-indexed coproduct of functors) as it is clearly explain <a href=http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf>here</a>. This means that the unpeel of the different <em>Effectful</em> layers are being done in compile time and at the same time it is constant with respect to the size of the Union.<p>Another important aspect of the implementation of the library is that it used a single <strong>Monad</strong> which is <code>Eff r a</code>, avoiding the need of stacking multiple Monad scaping to the quadratic $$O(n^2)$$ instance definitions problem in <strong>Monad Transformers</strong>. The common question that might arise here is: How the <strong>effects</strong> are handle if they are not stacked and are orthogonal? The answer is using <strong>Coroutines</strong>: <em>"a computation sends a request and suspends, waiting for a reply; a handler waits for a request, handles what it can, and resumes the client"</em><a href=http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/exteff.pdf>2</a>. This is implemented with Continuation Monad.<p>Lets see some examples on how to use it. For that propose I am going to use a real example that I had to do but i am going to change some names in order to preserve privacy and details of the solution behind.<h2 id=freer-simple-by-example>freer-simple by Example</h2><h3 id=use-case>Use Case</h3><p>The use case was the following:<pre class="language-shell z-code" data-lang=shell><code class=language-shell data-lang=shell><span class="z-text z-plain">As an user I want to upload some personal documents
to the system in order to complete my identification process.
</span></code></pre><p>This is also known as <em><strong>KYC (Known your Customer)</strong></em> process. So, lets assume that we need to run this kind of process and identify the user, asking for some personal documentation to verify them. In that case we need to be able to provide some mean to the user that is already registered in our System to allow them upload those documents.<p>Lets assume <strong>w.l.o.g.</strong> that our Solution is going to use <strong>AWS S3</strong> as a Storage Provider for the documentation and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as a Relational Database for storing related data to that user and document. We are going to need that DB in order to store the <strong>reference or document path to S3</strong> in order to be able to recover that specific document later if it is requested by the user or by other means.<p>On the other hand we are going to expose this capability as a <em>REST API</em> endpoint and we are going to use <a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant><strong>servant</strong></a> for that matter.<h3 id=program>Program</h3><p>First lets create the main algorithm of our program that should do the following:<ol><li>Received the Requested Document <code>ByteString</code> with some metadata associated in order to identify the user<li>If the user does not exist in our system (Not registered yet) throw an error.<li>If the user is registered, upload the document to S3<li>If the upload was successful, store the S3 reference to our DB<li>Return this reference to the user</ol><p>In Haskell lingua this should be like this<pre class="language-haskell z-code" data-lang=haskell><code class=language-haskell data-lang=haskell><span class="z-source z-haskell"><span class="z-meta z-import z-haskell"><span class="z-keyword z-other z-haskell">import</span>           <span class="z-support z-other z-module z-haskell">Control.Monad.Freer.Error</span> <span class="z-keyword z-other z-haskell">as</span> <span class="z-support z-other z-module z-haskell">FE</span></span>

</span></code></pre><p>Lets start analyzing this code. <code>Members '[DocStorage, DataAccess, Logging, AppError] eff</code> <em>Constraint</em> is indexed by an <strong>Open Union Type</strong> <code>[DocStorage, DataAccess, Logging, AppError]</code> whose <em>Coproduct</em> indicates what are the possible effects that <code>eff</code> can encode into. This is telling to the compiler that our <code>Eff eff a</code> are <em>constraining</em> by this <strong>Open Union Type</strong> and we can interleave any of those <em>Effects</em> throughout all the computation, without needing any lifting because we are not stacking <em>Monads</em> as in <strong>Monad Transformer</strong> approach.<p>We need to see now all the Effects that are involved in the <strong>Open Union Type</strong> which in this case are: <code>[DocStorage, DataAccess, Logging, AppError]</code>.<h3 id=effects>Effects</h3><p>In <strong>freer-simple</strong> library there is a tool set for defining <em>Custom Effects</em> as well as some already provided common effects that can be found in <strong>Monad Transformer</strong> libraries like <strong>mtl</strong>. In my example I am using both kind of effects, already built in effects that are packed with it <em>Handlers</em> and <em>Custom</em> Effects that we need to build and provider the specific <em>Handler</em> for them.<ul><li><p><em>Custom</em> effects in my example are: <code>DocStorage</code>, <code>DataAccess</code> and <code>Logging</code>. Last one could have been implemented using <code>Writer</code> effect provided by the library but I prefer something custom in order to interpret that effect using <a href=https://hackage.haskell.org/package/co-log>co-log</a> library.</p><li><p><em>Built-in</em> effect in this example is <code>AppError</code></p></ul><h4 id=custom-effects>Custom Effects</h4><p>In Custom Effects you need to provide the definition of the <strong>GADT</strong> which describes the Algebra of your Effect and the function that introduces or <code>send</code> that Algebra to the <code>Eff r a</code> <em>Monad</em> whose indexed <strong>Open Union Type</strong> is contained in. With this function we are injecting our <em>Algebra</em> into that index list.<blockquote><p>NOTE: It is important to point out that <strong>freer-simple</strong> provides <a href=https://wiki.haskell.org/Template_Haskell>Template Haskell</a> tooling for auto-generate the <code>send</code> injecting functions for us, but I've preferred to be a little more boilerplate for educational purpose.</blockquote><h4 id=docstorage-effect>DocStorage Effect</h4><pre class="language-haskell z-code" data-lang=haskell><code class=language-haskell data-lang=haskell><span class="z-source z-haskell"><span class="z-meta z-import z-haskell"><span class="z-keyword z-other z-haskell">import</span> <span class="z-support z-other z-module z-haskell">Control.Monad.Freer</span> <span class="z-keyword z-other z-haskell">as</span> <span class="z-support z-other z-module z-haskell">F</span></span>

Because of this, the <em>Effect</em> that is the first parameter passed to this interpreter is only indexed by <code>Logging</code> Algebra plus some possible rest of Algebras. This is Sum Type is indicated by the use of <em>Cons</em> <code>(':)</code> at Type level, finally returning that possible rest of effects without the <code>Logging</code> Algebra inside. This is a great and powerful semantic because we are stating by its types that we are taking of <code>Logging</code> Algebra and that is not going to be part anymore of the <em>Open Union</em> after this interpreter runs.<p>The <code>LastMember Handler effs</code> Constraint indicates that the last effect in the Stack is going to be <code>Handler</code>, since on top of this we are running a Servant API which is the last Monadic computation. This is not breaking any abstraction at all because this is the interpreter and not the Algebra, and we know that this interpreter is going to be use only by our <em>Servant</em> API. We can write other interpreters if we are in other context different that Servant.<h4 id=database-interpreter>Database Interpreter</h4><pre class="language-haskell z-code" data-lang=haskell><code class=language-haskell data-lang=haskell><span class="z-source z-haskell">

This interpretations are easy to built, avoiding the $$O(n^2)$$ problem on <strong>mtl</strong> instances without requiring <strong>Monad</strong> mock instances; and highly composable as well.<h2 id=acknowledges>Acknowledges</h2><p>Thank you to <a href=https://monadplus.pro/>@monadplus</a> who review this Article and help me to improve it.<h2 id=appendix-prerequisites-for-running-code>Appendix - Prerequisites for running code</h2><p>The following are prerequisites for running examples here:<h3 id=ghc>GHC</h3><ul><li>GHC 8.6.5 or above</ul><h3 id=language-extensions>Language Extensions</h3><pre class="language-yaml z-code" data-lang=yaml><code class=language-yaml data-lang=yaml><span class="z-source z-yaml"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-block z-sequence z-item z-yaml">-</span> <span class="z-string z-unquoted z-plain z-out z-yaml">DataKinds</span>
